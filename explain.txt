EXPLAINS TO MYSELF HOW DRAWING SCANLINE WORKS ON GB EMULATOR


When the screen is active, a status check of the LCDC register can confirm this. 
The PPU begins drawing the screen from the top-left corner and processes 
it line by line from top to bottom.

Hereâ€™s how the PPU operates during the rendering:

For scanlines ranging from 0 to 143, the PPU renders both the background and 
the window layers.
For scanlines between 144 and 153, the PPU enters the VBlank period. 
During this period, it triggers the VBlank interrupt.
The PPU also monitors the STAT register to determine if it needs to trigger any
 STAT interrupts.

The PPU sets different modes based on the scanline and other conditions:

If the current scanline is 144 or higher, the PPU sets the STAT mode to 1, 
indicating VBlank.
If the cycle counter is 376 or more, the PPU switches to STAT mode 2, which is
 the OAM access period.
If the cycle counter is at least 204, the PPU sets the STAT mode to 3, which is
 the period for drawing graphics.
If the cycle counter is less than 204, the PPU sets the STAT mode to 0, marking
 the HBlank period.
These modes transition from 2 (OAM access), to 3 (drawing), to 0 (HBlank), and 
continue in this sequence until VBlank is reached, at which point it remains in mode 1.

Whenever the mode changes and the corresponding STAT interrupt is enabled, the
PPU will trigger the relevant STAT interrupt.

the actual tile data is stored in vram from address 0x8000 to 0x97FF (that is a total of 6144 bytes or 384 tiles).
there are 3 blocks of 128 tiles each, each block is 16x16 tiles, each tile is 8x8 pixels.
